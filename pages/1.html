        Pizza0 uses Node.js to host their services and they want to evaluate Auth0 to provide the login and user
        management. In order to get started, make sure you have your Auth0 tenant set up (as described in <a
            href="/module-0">Prerequisites</a>).
        To get started with the integration, do the following:

            "CIC Workshop".

                    Our server is running on http://localhost:3000, and the SDK will automatically register a new
                    /callback route, so we can leave the default settings for callback URL (the URL a user is allowed to
                    be redirected to after successful login)
                    and logout URL.

                <p>
                    When copying the code provided into your project, only paste until (including) the
                    <code>app.use</code> statement. We already have an <code>app.get("/")</code> handler in our project,
                    so we are interested only in the part that checks
                    if the user is already authenticated. Second hint: Replace
                    <code>&lt;user is authenticated&gt;</code> in the project with
                    <code>req.oidc.isAuthenticated()</code>. This will automatically check if the user is signed in and
                    load the
                    order.html page if that is the case.
                </p>

            Save your project and start it up (by typing <code>node server.js</code> into your terminal). Then navigate to http://localhost:3000 
            and click on login. You can now sign in with your Auth0 credentials, and a consent screen should appear that
            you can accept.

        Congratulations, you now have a working login form! If you are doing this lab in a guided class, please wait for
        your instructor to continue the course. Otherwise, you may proceed to customizing the login to resemble the
        Pizza0 brand and user journey
        better.
