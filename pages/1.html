        Pizza0 uses Node.js to host their services and they want to evaluate Auth0 to provide the login and user
        management. In order to get started, make sure you have your Auth0 tenant set up (as described in <a
            href="/module-0">Prerequisites</a>).
        To get started with the integration, do the following:

            Go to "Applications" and register a new "Single Page Web Application". You can give it any name, for example
            "CIC Workshop".

                <p>
                    To specify the application client ID and domain, make a copy of `auth_config.json.example` and rename it to `auth_config.json`. Then open it in a text editor and supply the values for your application:

                    <code>
                    {
                    "domain": "",
                    "clientId": ""
                    }
                    </code>
                </p>
            </details>
            <br>

                <p>(Only applies if you're running this lab on your machine) <br>
                    Our server is running on http://localhost:3000, and the SDK will automatically register a new
                    /callback route, so we can leave the default settings for callback URL (the URL a user is allowed to
                    be redirected to after successful login)
                    and logout URL.
                </p>

            Save your project and start it up (by typing <code>npm run dev</code> into your terminal). Then navigate to http://localhost:3000 
            and click on login. You can now sign in with your Auth0 credentials, and a consent screen should appear that
            you can accept.

        Congratulations, you now have a working login form! If you are doing this lab in a guided class, please wait for
        your instructor to continue the course. Otherwise, you may proceed to customizing the login to resemble the
        Pizza0 brand and user journey
        better.
